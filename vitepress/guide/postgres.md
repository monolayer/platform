# PostgresDatabase

Workload for PostgreSQL databases.

## Description

With this workload, you can define PostgreSQL databases.

A [`PostgresDatabase`](./../reference/api/main/classes/PostgresDatabase.md) workload is initialized with a valid database name.

See [examples](#examples).

Each workload has an environment variable name associated with it that holds the connection
string for the database. The variable is named after the workload's [`databaseName`](./../reference/api/main/classes/PostgresDatabase.md#properties). For example:

- database name `products`: `ML_PG_PRODUCTS_DATABASE_URL`.

## Client

You can use **any** PostgreSQL database client with the workload.

See [examples](#examples).

## Server

By default, each `PostgresDatabase` is associated to a different database server.

## Development environment

A Docker container for the dev environment is launched with [`npx monolayer start dev`](./../reference/cli/start-dev.md)

You can stop it with [`npx monolayer stop dev`](./../reference/cli/stop-dev.md).

After the container is started:

- The environment variable with the connection string for the workload's Docker container
will be written to `.env.local`.
- The database will be created on the database server if it does not already exist.

:::info
Check your framework's documentation to see if the `.env.local` file is loaded automatically.
:::

## Test environment

A Docker container for the test environment is launched with [`npx monolayer start test`](./../reference/cli/start-test.md)

You can stop it with [`npx monolayer stop test`](./../reference/cli/stop-test.md).

- The environment variable with the connection string for the workload's Docker container
will be written to `.env.test.local`.
- The database will be created on the database server if it does not already exist.

:::info
Check your framework's documentation to see if the `.env.test.local` file is loaded automatically.

## Examples

### Using Workloads in the Same Database Server

```ts
import { PostgreSQL } from "@monolayer/sdk";
import pg from "pg";

export const productsDb = new PostgresDatabase("products");

const client = new pg.Pool({
  // Assumes the environment variable is set
  connectionString: process.env[productsDb.connectionStringEnvVar],
});

client.query("SELECT 1");
```

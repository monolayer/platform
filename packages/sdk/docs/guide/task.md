# Task

Workload for tasks (an operation or a job) that can be executed asynchronously.

## Description

With this workload, you can define tasks for your application, such as:

- Sending emails.
- Dispatching notifications.
- Generating reports.

Tasks can be performed immediately or enqueued (backed by `Redis` or `AWS SQS`).

A [`Task`](./../reference/api/main/classes/Task.md) is initialized with a unique name, a function to process the task, and the following options:

- [onError](./../reference/api/main/interfaces/TaskOptions.md#properties): function to handle errors.

- [retry](./../reference/api/main/interfaces/TaskOptions.md#properties): retry [options](./../reference/api/main/interfaces/RetryOptions.md) for the task.

You can provide a type parameter for the expected payload to use when sending and processing a task.

```ts
import { Task } from "@monolayer/sdk";

const confirmationEmail = new Task<{ email: string }>(
  "sendConfirmationEmail",
  async ({ taskId, data }) => {
    await mailer.client.sendMail({
      from: "sender@example.com",
      to: data.email,
      subject: "Message in a bottle",
      text: "I hope this message gets there!",
    });
  },
  {
    retry: {
      times: 3,
    },
    onError: (error) => {},
  }
);

export default confirmationEmail;
```

:::info **Important**
Export only one `Task` workload per file as the `default` export.
:::

Tasks can be performed immediately with [performNow](./../reference/api/main/classes/Task.md#performnow) or enqueued with [performLater](./../reference/api/main/classes/Task.md#performlater).

```ts
// Perform a task immediately
confirmationEmail.performNow({ email: "text@example.com" })

// Enqueue a task
confirmationEmail.performLater({ email: "text@example.com" })
confirmationEmail.performLater({ email: "text@example.com" }, { delay: 1000 });
```

## Development environment

Tasks are executed immediately.

## Test environment

Enqueued tasks with `performLater` will be collected in the test environment.

You can inspect the collected tasks with the `enqueuedTasks` test helper.
